	  EFUSE driver is a must. EFUSE Driver V1 includes the Sysfs driver.
	  EFUSE Sysfs driver v1 is supported in legacy platforms.
	  It is used to provide device information. The devinfo kernel API and
	  user-space API(including ioctl and sysfs) are provided for users to
	  query device information in an easier way.

	help
	  EFUSE driver is a must. EFUSE Driver V2 removes the Sysfs driver.
	  EFUSE Sysfs driver v1 is supported in legacy platforms.
	  V2 driver makes no difference with v1 driver except that devinfo
	  sysfs driver is removed in newer platforms because the atag has already
	  exported a device node by device tree. Thus, the sysfs driver will
	  be duplicated. So we use the atag device node in the new platforms
	  and deprecated the old EFUSE sysfs driver.
